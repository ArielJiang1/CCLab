                What do we know so far about the creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                It's the concrete image of one's mind and thoughts, showing how we're reacting to and communicate with
                the world. It lives in the universe of one's mind, and can be different in different people's brains,
                however the interactions it has with the outside world remain the same. It gains power from those little
                inspirations, and can be stimulated by the outside.

                How do we interact with this creature?

            <p>
                Give it a touch, then it'll change its color and shape.
